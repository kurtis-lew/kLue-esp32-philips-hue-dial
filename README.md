# ESP32 Philips Hue Control Dial

A variation of mnkii's esp32-philips-hue-button for controlling my Philips Hue with a custom dial using an HDD as a rotary encoder and two Cherry MX pushbuttons. Added OTA support from Andreas Spiess' tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pwqS_NUG7Q&t=183s (sketches at https://github.com/SensorsIot/ESP32-OTA)
